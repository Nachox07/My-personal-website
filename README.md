# My personal website

This repository contains the Frontend of my personal website. It basically requests an API which apart from connect to a MariaDB containing my projects, it also retrieves my latests tweets.

## Technologies used

React with Typescript, also the project was not ejected because there is no need of more customization or architecture by the moment.
